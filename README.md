MOAR LESS Elements
==================
These mixins were originally based on their better known ancestor LESS Elements (at <http://lesselements.com>), but they are
a set of useful mixins for LESS, the CSS pre-processor (<http://lesscss.org>).

Due to the lack of organization and frequency of updates of its ancestor, I decided to fork to a cleaner version of the codebase.


## How to Contribute
I am by no means an expert at LESS mixins, but I will try my best to keep this as up to date as possible, but you can help.

* fork and submit pull requests
* submit issues
* edit the wiki
* message me directly

I want this LESS mixin toolset to be as rich as possible and it can only get better with your help.


Oreolek has a good fork with the mixins organized under namespaces here: https://github.com/Oreolek/elements
I recommend going with that if you use other frameworks like Bootstrap to avoid clashes.

## Things to Mention
Oreolek was mentioned to have a namespaced fork of the original LESS Elements codebase where the mixins are provided under a
hash-namespace (nested mixins, so to speak). I would like to do the same here, but I need your feedback to determine the best
way to namespace these mixins.
