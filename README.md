# MOAR Elements
These mixins were originally based on their better known ancestor, LESS Elements (https://github.com/tomokane/elements).

MOAR Elements was created fork to provide a cleaner codebase and more up-to-date mixins.

## Final Release
**Version 2.0.0 is the final release.** Browsers are doing much better at keeping up with new CSS specifications, which makes it difficult to keep this library up to date. Additionally, the majority of remaining mixins are those that provide convenience, rather than necessity. All of these factors combined, results in MOAR Elements no longer providing utility to the web developer community.

Thank you all for using MOAR Elements and helping to contribute.
